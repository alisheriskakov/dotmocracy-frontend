# dotmocracy-frontend
Frontend for Software Engineering project
## How to setup
**Install nodejs v9.4.0 and npm v5.6.0**

*Windows:*

https://nodejs.org/dist/v9.4.0/node-v9.4.0-x64.msi

*MacOS:*

https://nodejs.org/dist/v9.4.0/node-v9.4.0.pkg

After installing that, both nodejs and npm should be installed.


**Setup project**

Go to a preferred directory and clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/alisheriskakov/dotmocracy-frontend.git
```
Go to the directory of the repository:
```
cd dotmocracy-frontend
```
Install the dependencies (npm is a package manager with its own central repository; you can read more on that [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)):
```
npm i
```


**Run project on localhost**

Open your terminal or cmd in the project folder and type:
```
npm start
```
This should start the application on localhost:3000. Go to http://localhost:3000 and if you see a page, then everything works fine!
